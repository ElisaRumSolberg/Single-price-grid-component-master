## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.

## My Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 markup**: Ensuring the document is well-structured and accessible.
- **CSS custom properties**: Using variables for a more maintainable codebase.
- **CSS Grid**: For an efficient and responsive layout structure.
- **Flexbox**: To create a flexible and intuitive design for components.
- **Mobile-first workflow**: Designing for mobile devices first, then scaling up for larger screens.

### What I Learned

I learned how to effectively use **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** to create a responsive and clean layout. Here is a code snippet that demonstrates a technique I’m particularly proud of:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

This challenge also helped me understand the importance of a **mobile-first approach** to ensure a smooth and adaptive user experience.

### Continued Development

I plan to focus on:

- Improving the **use of media queries** for better responsiveness.
- Enhancing my understanding of **CSS Grid** and how to utilize it for more complex layouts.
- Working on more projects that require **hover and interactive states** to sharpen my CSS skills.

### Useful Resources
